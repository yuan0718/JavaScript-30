			// start with strings, numbers and booleans

			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

			// and we want to make a copy of it.

			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			const team = players;
			console.log(players);
			//console.log(team);

			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// team[2] = 'hi';
			// console.log(players);
			// console.log(team);

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

			// one way

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in

			// or use the new ES6 Spread

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			const team1 = players.slice();
			team1[2] = 'hi';
			const team2 = Array.from(players);
			team2[2] = 'ha';
			const team3 = [...players];
			team3[2] = 'world';
			// concat 合併Array
			const team4 = [].concat(players);
			team4[2] = 'www';
			console.log(team1);
			console.log(team2);
			console.log(team3);
			console.log(team4);

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: 'Wes Bos',
				age: 80,
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const dev = person;
			// dev.name = 'yuan';
			console.log(person);
			console.log(dev);
			// how do we take a copy instead?
      // 淺拷貝
			const dev2 = Object.assign({}, person);
			dev2.name = 'yuan';
			console.log(person);
			console.log(dev2);
			const dev3 = { ...person };
			dev3.name = 'hallo';
			console.log(dev3);
			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
			const author = {
				name: 'Wes Bos',
				age: 80,
				social: {
					name: 'yuan',
					age: 18,
				},
			};
      // 深拷貝
			const au2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(author));
			au2.name = '蘋果';
			au2.social.name = '水果'
			console.log(author);
			console.log(au2);
